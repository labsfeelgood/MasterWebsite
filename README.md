# Galileo Protocol

Galileo Protocol is a blockchain-based platform that provides a secure and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps). The platform utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called the Proof-of-Usage (PoU) that rewards users for utilizing the network resources. Galileo Protocol offers features such as smart contracts, cross-chain compatibility, and privacy protection.
